# Authorship Identification Using Enron Email Dataset


## Introduction
Emails have become a critical mode of communication in the digital era, but they are also susceptible to cybercrimes like phishing, spamming, and identity theft. To address these issues, our project aims to develop a machine learning-based solution that can accurately identify the true author of an email. By leveraging advanced algorithms and statistical techniques, we will train our model to detect patterns in email content, structure, and metadata. This solution will enable users to verify the authenticity of the sender, prevent unauthorized access to user accounts, and minimize the spread of malware through suspicious emails.



## Dataset
For this project we are using the ENRON Email dataset. The size of the dataset is 1.7GB and here is the link to download the entire dataset.

## Steps to Run the project
1. Download the dataset using the link provided and extract the zip file.
2. Once the dataset is unziped and ready, download all the 5 python notebook(.ipynb) files.
3. Make sure that the notebooks and dataset are under the same folder.
4. Now start running all the notebooks one after the other and make sure to follow the instruction commented in each notebooks.
5. After running the notebook a new enron.csv file will be created and after running the next notebook a Enron_29_Features.csv will be created.
